    },
    url: "https://github.com/your-pipeline-repo",
    description: "A clear, concise description of your pipeline..."
}
```

### üìù Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Set Up Your Development Environment**:
   - Fork and clone the repository (see Contribution Workflow above)
   - Create a new branch for your pipeline
   - Make sure you can run the application locally

2. **Prepare Your Files**:
   - Create your pipeline workflow diagram
   - Save it in the `assets/` directory
   - Follow the naming convention: `pipelineN.png`

3. **Add Pipeline Object**:
   - Open `pipelineObjects.js`
   - Add your pipeline object to the `preLoadedObjects` array
   - Include the `workflowImage` property pointing to your image
   - Ensure all attributes are properly set

4. **Test Locally**:
   - Run the application on your machine
   - Complete all testing steps (see Testing Your Addition below)
   - Fix any issues you find

5. **Submit Your Changes**:
   - Commit your changes with a clear message
   - Push to your fork
   - Create a pull request
   - Wait for review and feedback

6. **Verify Integration**:
   Your pipeline will automatically appear in:
   - üìä **Questionnaire Results**: When users answer questions matching your pipeline's attributes
   - üñºÔ∏è **Pipeline Gallery**: With your workflow diagram and description
   - üìã **Comparison Table**: In the interactive comparison table

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- All attributes must be arrays containing exactly one value
- Valid values for Yes/No questions: `["Yes"]` or `["No"]`
- The `workflowImage` path must be relative to the root directory
- Keep descriptions clear and concise (2-3 sentences recommended)
- Ensure your workflow diagram is clear and readable at the recommended size

### ‚úÖ Example Pipeline Object

```javascript
{
    id: "pipeline31"
    name: "Metagenome-Atlas",
    attributes: {
        shortReads: ["Yes"],
        PacBio: ["No"],
        OxfordNanopore: ["No"],
        hybridAssembly: ["No"],
        multiSample: ["Yes"],
        coAssemblyCoBinning: ["Yes"],

### üß™ Testing Your Addition

1. **Image Testing**:
   - Verify the workflow image appears in the pipeline gallery
   - Check that the image is clear and properly sized
   - Ensure the image loads correctly in different browsers

2. **Pipeline Object Testing**:
   - Complete the questionnaire with answers matching your pipeline
   - Verify your pipeline appears in the results
   - Check the comparison table for your pipeline
   - Verify all attributes display correctly
   - Test the pipeline gallery entry

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test the questionnaire with various answer combinations
   - Verify your pipeline's score calculation
   - Check the comparison table filtering
   - Test the pipeline gallery navigation

### üéØ Best Practices

1. **Workflow Diagrams**:
   - Use clear, professional diagrams
   - Include key steps and data flow
   - Use consistent colors and symbols
   - Keep text readable at the recommended size
   - Use standard bioinformatics workflow symbols

2. **Pipeline Descriptions**:
   - Start with the main purpose
   - Highlight key features
   - Mention target users
   - Keep it concise but informative
   - Use clear, technical language

3. **Attribute Selection**:
   - Be accurate and honest
   - Consider edge cases
   - Document any assumptions
   - Keep up to date with pipeline changes
   - Test all features before marking as "Yes"

Remember: Your pipeline's information helps researchers make informed decisions. Accuracy and clarity are crucial! üéØ
